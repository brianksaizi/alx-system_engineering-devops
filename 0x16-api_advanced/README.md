Background Context
Understanding APIs is crucial in modern software development as they facilitate communication and data exchange between different systems and applications. Practicing API calls using the Reddit API provides hands-on experience in working with real-world data sources and enriches your skill set as a software developer.

Learning Objectives:

Gain proficiency in making API calls and handling JSON responses.
Develop error handling strategies for dealing with invalid inputs and API errors.
Enhance Python programming skills through practical application.
Resources
To support your learning journey, we recommend the following resources:

Reddit API Documentation
Python Requests Library Documentation
Error Handling in Python
Understanding JSON in Python
