Issue Summary:

Duration: On the fateful day of May 10, 2024, chaos ensued in our web stack universe from 3:45 PM to 7:30 PM (UTC), a span of 3 hours and 45 minutes, forever etched in the annals of downtime disasters.

Impact: Picture this: all services hosted on our primary web stack took an unexpected siesta, including our beloved website, API endpoints, and their microservice minions. User experience? Let's just say it was akin to trying to swim through a pool of molasses - impossible. 100% of users found themselves locked out of our digital kingdom during this dark period.

Root Cause: Brace yourselves for the epic saga of the misconfigured load balancer, the unsuspecting villain behind this digital apocalypse.

Timeline:

Detection: The day started innocently enough until 3:45 PM (UTC) when our monitoring systems went berserk, belting out alerts like an opera soprano on caffeine. It was clear that something was amiss in our digital domain.
Investigation: Engineers sprang into action faster than a cat chasing a laser pointer, initially suspecting a nefarious DDoS attack. But alas, it was not the work of cyber villains but the subtle mischief of misconfigured machinery.
Misleading Paths: Like Sherlock Holmes on a particularly puzzling case, we entertained theories of rogue deployments and ghostly bugs. However, the truth was far less sinister - a mere slip-up in the load balancer settings.
Escalation: As the clock ticked ominously, and the panic levels reached DEFCON 5, the incident was escalated to the highest echelons of our engineering command. Senior engineers and system architects descended from their ivory towers to join the fray.
Resolution: Lo and behold, at 7:30 PM (UTC), after much sweating and swearing, the misconfigured load balancer was unmasked. With a few keystrokes and incantations, the order was restored, and the digital sun rose once more over our beleaguered servers.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Our culprit, the load balancer, had unwittingly funneled an avalanche of traffic onto a single backend database server, drowning it in a sea of requests. By reverting the load balancer to its former glory, we banished the bottleneck and restored harmony to our digital realm. The day was saved!

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent future calamities, we embarked on a quest to fortify our defenses. Load balancer configurations were scrutinized with the intensity of a medieval siege, and monitoring systems were beefed up to sniff out misconfigurations before they could wreak havoc. Additionally, we instituted a strict review process for infrastructure changes, ensuring that only the bravest and most battle-tested updates pass muster.

In conclusion, while the outage may have tested our mettle, it also reminded us of the importance of vigilance and preparedness in the ever-changing landscape of cyberspace. Let this saga serve as a cautionary tale to all who dare to navigate the treacherous waters of web stack management.
