Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred on May 10, 2024, starting at 3:45 PM (UTC) and lasting until 7:30 PM (UTC), resulting in a downtime of approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes.

Impact: The outage affected all services hosted on our primary web stack, including the main website, API endpoints, and associated microservices. User experience was severely impacted, with 100% of users unable to access the platform during the outage period.

Root Cause: The outage's root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an overload on a critical backend database server.

Timeline:

Detection: The outage was first detected at 3:45 PM (UTC) through automated monitoring alerts indicating a significant increase in error rates across various services.
Investigation: Engineers immediately initiated an investigation into the issue, initially suspecting a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden surge in traffic. However, further analysis revealed inconsistencies in the traffic patterns, prompting a deeper dive into the infrastructure components.
Misleading Paths: Initially, there was a brief consideration that a recent deployment might have introduced a bug causing the increased load. However, this theory was quickly dismissed after reviewing the deployment logs and confirming no significant changes were made to the affected services.
Escalation: As the investigation progressed, it became evident that the issue was beyond a routine maintenance fix. The incident was escalated to senior engineers and system architects for additional expertise and guidance.
Resolution: At 7:30 PM (UTC), after extensive troubleshooting, the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings was identified as the primary culprit. Immediate corrective actions were taken to revert the load balancer configuration to its last known stable state, restoring normal traffic distribution and resolving the outage.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused an imbalance in traffic distribution, directing excessive requests to a single backend database server. This resulted in a bottleneck, causing the server to become overwhelmed and unable to handle the incoming requests effectively.

The load balancer configuration was rolled back to a previously known stable state to resolve the issue, restoring proper traffic distribution across the backend servers. Additionally, measures were implemented to improve monitoring and alerting systems for more proactive detection of similar misconfigurations in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Immediate corrective measures included conducting a thorough review of all load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any other potential misconfigurations. Additionally, engineers implemented enhanced monitoring checks to promptly detect and alert any abnormal traffic patterns or server loads.

To prevent similar incidents in the future, a comprehensive review process for infrastructure changes was established, requiring rigorous testing and validation before any modifications were applied to critical components. Furthermore, ongoing training and knowledge-sharing sessions were scheduled to ensure all team members were well-versed in best practices for maintaining system reliability and resilience.

In conclusion, while the outage caused significant disruption, it served as a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of robust monitoring, thorough investigation protocols, and proactive maintenance strategies to mitigate and prevent similar incidents in the future.
